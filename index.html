      <p class="text-muted">Finally after pondering over when to visit this cafe, I ultimately managed to make it to this cafe yesterday evening. Though I reached at 7 pm, the cafe was crowded and people were awaiting their turns. My visit to this cafe was actually basis the reviews and the photos that I had seen on Zomato and this exactly matched my expectations.

        This cafe is at a walking distance from the Tulip Star hotel. This is in the same complex as the Prithvi Theatre. An open air cafe. As we visited in the evening it was fully lit up with bulbs. Its nicely surrounded by trees and has a seating area for around 50-60 pax. As you enter the cafe, there is also a bookstore. If you wanna notice actors from theatre or serials this is one of the place where they can be seen.
        
        Coming to the stuff we ordered: Had ordered for couple of pav bhajis and suleimani chai. Would rate the pav bhaji among the best that I would have had anywhere.
        
        Coming to the service....when we ordered for the pav bhaji, the waiter told us that it would take 20 mins for it to be served, but actually got it in 10 mins.
        
        Overall a super place....will definitely visit again

<p class="text-muted">These are solar devices built to track the heavens for the purpose of astrology. Remarkable large and accurate observation devices. Clean, well maintained grounds with descriptive signs at the devices. Worth a stop</p>

  <p>This film is an emotional rollercoaster with some of the coolest superhero plot lines ever drawn up. It's straight up the most epic Marvel film that will probably ever be created. I don't see how Marvel could ever top this, but getting to see these characters all together at least one last time was a reward all on its own.</p>
